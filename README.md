# "Crafting Interpreters" textbook implementation

This is all based on the lovely [text by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). None of this is really my IP or original work, really, just a C++ re-implementation of that textbooks work. I figured I'd upload it and push it here to both track my own progress and make it easier to synchronize my progress across the different machines I work on... I was briefly copying zips of source code like a madman. 

For now it just has the simple AST-based treewalk interpreter, the one that is implemented in javascript in the original textbook. Once I get to the bytecode virtual machine, I'll either make that a separate branch or better organize the source code here. I really recommend Robert's book, it's well-written and fun and is a great starting point for learning about compilers!

It's definitely got me more interested in compiler and language design, and as someone who works in graphics dev and needs to work with shader languages... this is not a bad thing to know about. Especially not if you want to make a robust and performant shader editing system, nodegraphs or otherwise :)
